Hello! Welcome to my personal site. I'm going with the name "Mike-Zone" for now. I thought the name was funny and it describes well enough what this is. I am Mike and this my zone. I play a lot of video games, and have minimal coding experience. This site I plan on using as a way to catalog the games I've played, and get some experience with working Jekyll as a static site generator. 

Now by games I've played, what does that exactly mean? Is it a game I booted up once for an hour and never touched again? Maybe it's a game I played to completion getting a 100% save file? My current definition I'll be basing this list off of are games that I've "beat". This means I played through the main presented content and got the credits to roll. An example of this would be playing Super Mario 64 and finishing the game after collecting 70 Stars. This is the minimum amount of Stars to confront the final level, defeat the final bowser, and complete the game's story. 

Why am I making this exactly? Well, I've played many different video games throughout my lifetime and I would say it's my main source of entertainment. I've played the hits, the classics, hidden gems, bad games, fun games, etc. While there are many different ways to see a list of games you've played, I wanted a comprehensive list all in one spot. My steam library is filled with lots of junk as the result of getting game bundles, free games, etc. and my game activity on most consoles can only be viewed from within that console. I would also like to write opinion pieces, whether they are full blown reviews, thoughts on a game, a game's genre, trends, etc. 

If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope to continue working on this site and updating it frequently enough.
